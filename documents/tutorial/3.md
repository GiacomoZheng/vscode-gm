# *constant*

Many language is allow users to change the ***value*** of an [pointer](2#pointer), where such a pointer is a ***quantity***. Almost all the programming languages but functional ones sort the "***quantity***" and "***value***". (For example, the `pointer` in `C` is a type of ***quantity*** (like `int*`), and the `address` in `C` is the type of ***value***)

However, here, `gm` is a language basing on the mathematics, in which we don't differ the *quantities* and *values*. I cannot stand to use the same identifier to represent different meanings in the same situation. Therefore, all the definitions are immutable in `gm`. 

In addition, thanks to the immutability, I can make the order of definitions irrelevant. 

People use the `constant` means the pointer 

# *temporary*

(I used the word *variable*, but it is confusing. The concept of [variable]() in `erlang` has the similar meaning with the `temporary` here.)
