## Features

gm is a language basing on my writing habits of mathematics, with lots of special symbols,

![looks](images/overall.jpg)

which looks like this one. (with the extension `Bracket Pair Colorizer 2`)

It is much more like mathemtics than a programming lauguage indeed.

## Extension Settings

It is better to add some settings (in [settings](plugins/settings/README)) into `settings.json`, which build in the function of `better-comments` of `aaron-bond`. I have got the permission from him.
<!-- the path of settings may be wrong -->

## Requirements

None

If it is possible, the Windows' users can try to learn something about [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/), which helps a lot. [Here](plugins/AutoHotKey/) is my source file.

For the Mac's and Linus' users, I'm sorry but you can try other hotkey apps.

<!-- ## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension. -->

## Recommendation

[bracket-pair-colorizer-2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) is a beautiful and powerful extension and it support all languages. You can directly use it after intalling.

[Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) is a useful extension, but it (2.0.2) doesn't support gm directly. In the latest version of `gm` (`1.0.5`), I build in the function of the `better comments` into the sytnax, with the help of some other configurations.

## Release Notes

Go to [Changelog](CHANGELOG) for details.
