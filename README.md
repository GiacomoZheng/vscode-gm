## Features

gm is a language basing on my writing habits of mathematics, with lots of special symbols,

which looks like this one. (with the extension better-comment)

It is much more like mathemtics than a programming lauguage indeed.

## Requirements

None

If it is possible, the Windows' users can try to learn something about autoHotKey, which helps a lot. [Here](https://github.com/GiacomoZheng/vscode-gm/tree/master/plugins/autoHotKey) is my source file.

For the Mac's and Linus' users, I'm sorry but you can try other hotkey apps.

## Recommendation 

[bracket-pair-colorizer-2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) is a beautiful and powerful extension and it support all languages. You can directly use it after intalling.

[Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) is a useful extension, but it doesn't support gm directly.

## Extension Settings

None up to now.
