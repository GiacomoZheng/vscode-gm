## Features

gm is a language basing on my writing habits of mathematics, with lots of special symbols,

which looks like this one. (with the extension better-comment)

It is much more like mathemtics than a programming lauguage indeed.

## Requirements

None

If it is possible, the Windows' users can try to learn something about autoHotKey, which helps a lot.

For the Mac's and Linus' users, I'm sorry but you can try other hotkey apps.

## Extension Settings

none up to now.
